# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Homeward is a custom standalone VSCode-based AI-IDE application designed for personal use. It provides all the capabilities of Kiro but with expanded LLM support beyond Claude models, including GPT, GLM, Kimi, and other language models. The application will be a complete IDE experience with integrated AI assistance, file management, and development tools.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a standalone VSCode-based IDE application, so that I can have a complete development environment without relying on external VSCode installations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is launched THEN the system SHALL display a VSCode-based interface with all core IDE functionality
2. WHEN the user opens files THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting, code completion, and file editing capabilities
3. WHEN the user navigates the file system THEN the system SHALL provide a file explorer with standard file operations
4. IF the application is closed THEN the system SHALL save the current workspace state and restore it on next launch

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use multiple LLM providers (GPT, Claude, GLM, Kimi, etc.), so that I can choose the best model for different tasks and have flexibility in AI assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses AI features THEN the system SHALL provide a model selection interface with multiple LLM options
2. WHEN the user selects a different LLM provider THEN the system SHALL switch the active model without requiring application restart
3. WHEN the user configures API keys THEN the system SHALL securely store credentials for each LLM provider
4. IF an LLM provider is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to alternative providers or display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Kiro features available in Homeward, so that I can maintain the same workflow and capabilities I'm familiar with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user interacts with the AI assistant THEN the system SHALL provide chat-based code assistance, file analysis, and project guidance
2. WHEN the user creates specs THEN the system SHALL support the complete spec workflow (requirements, design, tasks)
3. WHEN the user works with files THEN the system SHALL provide context-aware AI suggestions and code generation
4. WHEN the user manages projects THEN the system SHALL support steering files, hooks, and MCP integration
5. IF the user uses autopilot mode THEN the system SHALL allow autonomous file modifications within the workspace

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration between the IDE and AI features, so that I can efficiently develop software with AI assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects code THEN the system SHALL provide contextual AI actions in the right-click menu
2. WHEN the user opens the AI chat THEN the system SHALL automatically include relevant file context
3. WHEN the AI suggests code changes THEN the system SHALL provide inline diff views and easy acceptance/rejection
4. WHEN the user works on tasks THEN the system SHALL integrate task management with the file explorer and editor

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be performant and stable, so that I can rely on it for daily development work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load within 5 seconds on standard hardware
2. WHEN processing AI requests THEN the system SHALL provide loading indicators and allow cancellation
3. WHEN handling large files THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive UI performance
4. IF errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them appropriately and provide user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize the IDE appearance and behavior, so that I can tailor the environment to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL provide theme customization options
2. WHEN the user configures keybindings THEN the system SHALL allow custom keyboard shortcuts
3. WHEN the user set up workspace preferences THEN the system SHALL persist settings per project
4. WHEN the user installs extensions THEN the system SHALL support VSCode-compatible extensions where applicable
